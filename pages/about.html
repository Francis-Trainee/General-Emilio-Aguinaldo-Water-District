    <h1>History of GEAWD</h1>
    <p>
      Before 1996, the Bailen people had virtually no access to clean water.
      The flow of water from the Amontay River, the only supplier, did not
      reach the village due to droughts and a lack of proper water
      connections. Residents had to rely on small streams or broken pipes to
      get water, causing great distress, especially among children.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many residents struggled to collect water from small, distant tubs, and
      even when pools were built, the supply remained insufficient. It took a
      lot of effort just to fill a bucket. During this period, the water
      crisis in the area was severe, leading to frustration and desperation
      among the people.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kgg. Major Nestorio Belostrino sought to address this crisis by
      replacing some distribution lines and adding new faucets in different
      corners to help residents access water. With assistance from former
      Governor Juanito Remulla, a 4" diameter transmission line was built from
      Kalipay to the capital, significantly improving the water supply.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, the water supply still fell short of meeting the needs of the
      growing population. The Bukal of Lightning's supply to Kulipay was only
      six liters per second, sufficient for only 600 families, while 1,500
      families needed water. This shortage led to long waits for water, with
      residents often forced to carry containers to communal faucets under the
      scorching sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      By 1996, the water situation had worsened. Collections were difficult,
      many residents were not paying, and illegal connections were increasing.
      The water lines were deteriorating, and there were no funds to replace
      old pipes or buy meters, leading to a severe water crisis.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meetings were held to discuss solutions, and it became clear that
      waiting for government funding could take over a decade. To address the
      problem more quickly, the idea of establishing a Water District was
      proposed, similar to other towns in Cavite.
    </p>
    <p>
      After careful study, Major Nestorio Belotrino introduced G. Aquilino
      Reyes to contact the Local Water Utilities Administration (LWUA) in
      Balara, Q.C. to establish the Water District. After discussions with
      LWUA, the application was processed, and the Certificate of Conditional
      Conformance was obtained on October 15, 1996. With the establishment of
      the Water District, proper management of the water supply began.
